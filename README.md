# HCF/GCD of Two Numbers in Java

This project demonstrates three different methods to calculate the Highest Common Factor (HCF) or Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers in Java.

## Methods Implemented

1. **Brute Force (gcd1)**: Checks all numbers up to the minimum of the two inputs.
2. **Reverse Brute Force (gcd2)**: Checks from the minimum down to 1, stopping at the first common divisor.
3. **Euclidean Algorithm (gcd3)**: Efficiently computes GCD using modulo operations.

## Usage

1. Compile the code:
    ```sh
    javac GCD.java
    ```
2. Run the program:
    ```sh
    java GCD
    ```
3. Enter two integers when prompted.

## Example

```
Input:
12
18

Output:
The HCF is: 6
```
